Custom Message Encoder-Decoder

Welcome to the Custom Message Encoder-Decoder! This project lets you securely encode any message into a unique format and decode it back with ease. The encoded message is impossible to decode without this exact script, ensuring privacy and security.

Key Features

Customizable Encoding – Encode messages into any number of characters you choose.

Unique Decoding – Only this script can decode messages, adding an extra layer of security.

Simple to Use – Just run the script, enter your message, and choose how you want it encoded.

How It Works

Encoding – Enter any message, and the script will transform it into an encoded format based on your chosen parameters.

Decoding – Decode the encoded message back to the original form using the same script.

Security – The encoded message cannot be decrypted by external tools or scripts.

Why Use This?

Confidential Messaging – Keep your messages safe and unreadable by others.

Creative Encoding – Customize how your message is encoded with flexibility.

No Third-Party Tools – No external software is required for decoding; only this script can unlock your messages.
